            <p>Abu Bakr Abdullah ibn Uthman (Arabic: أَبُو بَكْرٍ عَبْدُ ٱللهِ بْنِ عُثْمَانَ‎; c. 573 CE – 23 August 634 CE),[a] was a companion and, through his daughter Aisha,[1] a father-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, as well as the first of the Rashidun Caliphs.
                Initially a rich and respected businessman,
                Abu Bakr later became one of the first converts to Islam and extensively contributed his wealth in support of Muhammad's work. He was among Muhammad's closest companions,[2] accompanying him on his migration to Medina and being present at a number of his military 
                conflicts, such as the battles of Badr and Uhud.</p>
